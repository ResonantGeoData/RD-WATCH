## Introduction

RDWATCH (**R**esonantGeo**D**ata **WATCH**) is a modern web application that offers easy access to a wide range of remote sensing imagery, as well as AI-generated outputs, to aid in the detection of global scale changes. RDWATCH enhances the AI workflow by providing monitoring, annotating, and visualizing capabilities within a geospatial context. The web interface of RDWATCH prioritizes user experience and performance for different user groups, including analysts, annotators, and algorithm developers. It enables analysts to thoroughly examine model outputs, allows annotators to work within a geospatial context, and assists developers in comparing results with ground truth to identify potential model failures.


# RDWATCH Features

## For Developers

-  **Scalable and Modular Architecture**: Built on top of widely used Django web framework and open source geospatial technologies in a architecture that is flexible and extensible.

-  **Efficient Data Management**: RDWATCH provides domain specific data models that provide fast search across data types.

-  **Advanced Technology Stack**: Leverage dynamic vector tiles, open standards like STAC, and open-source software (MapLibre, Vue.js) on AWS for scalability.

## For Annotators and Analysts

-  **Enhanced Workflow**: Interfaces for efficient monitoring, annotating, and visualizing geospatial data within a geospatial context.

-  **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic observation of data changes over time, directly in the web interface, enhancing the annotation process.

-  **Exporting Capabilities**: Easily export model outputs and imagery, facilitating collaboration and sharing in formats like GIF and GeoJSON.
