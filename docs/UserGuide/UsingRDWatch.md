# Using RDWATCH

RDWATCH has the two main modes: **Analyst** and **Annotator** as well as either being connected to the **RDWATCH** or **Scoring** database.  While there are these different modes most of the interface is shared with minor changes between the modes and the source database.  This page will give a high level overview of the main UI elements that are shared.

## [Model Run List (Left Side Panel)](LeftSidePanel.md)

The Left Side panel contains tools for selecting modes, adjusting the global Timeline, Filtering Model Runs and providing a list of Model Runs to select.

## [Layer Manager](LayerManager.md)

The LayerManager manages what polygons are displayed on the map and filters based on time/coloring or other items.
